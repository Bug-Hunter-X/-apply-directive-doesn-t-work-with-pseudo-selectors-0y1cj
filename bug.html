This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector, such as `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive will only apply the styles for the base state, and will not apply the styles for the pseudo-selector states. For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

In this case, the `bg-blue-500` class will only be applied when the button is not hovered, and will not be applied when the button is hovered. This is because the `@apply` directive only applies the styles for the base selector.
