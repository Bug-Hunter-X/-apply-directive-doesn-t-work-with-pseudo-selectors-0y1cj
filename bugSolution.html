The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with pseudo-selectors. Instead, apply the styles directly to the element or apply the base class and the hover class separately.

Here's how to fix the bug:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

This directly applies the hover style to the button. Alternatively, you can separate the base class and the hover class:

```html
<button class="bg-gray-300 hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```
This approach is generally preferred for better readability and maintainability.
